That is if we increase our value of *b*, we expect the average deviation to change by a similar amount.  So now imagine we take our first guess of b, and set b equal to 100.  You can see, from the plot of the average error on the right that this gives us an average error of -43.67.  So if changing our b value a certain amount, changes our average error by the same amount, we can simply decrease our b value by 43.67."

The error at x=100 rises by about 50 or so, but the error at point 400 rises by what, another 300?  A lot.
